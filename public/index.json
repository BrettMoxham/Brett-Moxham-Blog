For example, we can rename it to docs for software/project documentation or tutorials for creating an online course.\nDelete tutorials To remove these pages, delete the courses folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.\nUpdate site menu After renaming or deleting the courses folder, you may wish to update any [[main]] menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at config/_default/menus.toml.\nFor example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Courses\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;courses/\u0026quot; weight = 50  Or, if you are creating a software documentation site, you can rename the courses folder to docs and update the associated Courses menu configuration to:\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Docs\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;docs/\u0026quot; weight = 50  Update the docs menu If you use the docs layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form [menu.X] where X is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the courses/example/ folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within courses/example/ from [menu.example] to [menu.\u0026lt;NewFolderName\u0026gt;].\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"59c3ce8e202293146a8a934d37a4070b","permalink":"/courses/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/example/","section":"courses","summary":"Learn how to use Academic's docs layout for publishing online courses, software documentation, and tutorials.","tags":null,"title":"Overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
